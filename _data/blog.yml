    description: "In this project, the limited data problem in visual sentiment analysis was addressed by employing a combination of advanced methodologies. The approaches used included N-way-k-shot few-shot learning to handle the limited data scenario and semi-supervised learning to augment the data using pseudo-labeled data. The results of this innovative approach have been submitted to Data & Knowledge Engineering of ScienceDirect."
