  - name: "Visual Sentiment Analysis Using Ensemble Learning"
    description: "In this project, visual sentiment analysis was conducted on AffectNet using homogeneous ensemble learning with weighted voting. The approach involved utilizing seven models, including a proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) and six transfer learning models. By employing weighted voting, the method leveraged the diverse strengths of each model. This innovative technique outperformed numerous existing approaches in the field of visual sentiment analysis."

  - name: "Brain Tumor Detection from Augmented MRI Images"
    description: "In this project, brain tumors were detected from MRI images using a fine-tuned Deep CNN model trained on the Br35H benchmark dataset. The model was trained using k-fold cross-validation to demonstrate model generalization and Grad-CAM to visualize and interpret model predictions. The results were published in the Journal of Autonomous Intelligence by Frontier Scientific Publishing."
