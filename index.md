I have a strong passion for deep learning, with a solid background in image processing, computer vision, and advanced deep-learning techniques. I completed an Integrated Master of Science in Computer Science, during which I collaborated on scholarly articles focusing on deep learning methodologies for sentiment analysis and medical image analysis. These experiences significantly enhanced my technical skills and reinforced my commitment to advancing the field of deep learning. A relentless curiosity drives me to unravel complex problems and translate innovative ideas into practical applications.
