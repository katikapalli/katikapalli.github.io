I am a research enthusiast with a strong foundation in Computer Vision. Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant in the [Vision, Language, and Learning Group (VL2G)](https://vl2g.github.io) at the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, advised by [Prof. Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/). I am currently leading two projects: first one tackling the scarcity of paired image-text data in medical domains by leveraging the text generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and second one enhancing the quality of degraded ancient Indian manuscripts through advanced deep learning techniques.
