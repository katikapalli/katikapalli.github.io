I am deeply passionate about deep learning, specializing in image processing and computer vision. My interest in this field grew during my Integrated Master of Science in Computer Science at the Central University of Rajasthan, where I actively engaged in academic exploration and research. During this time, I collaborated on scholarly articles focusing on deep-learning techniques for sentiment analysis and medical image analysis. These experiences significantly enhanced my technical skills and reinforced my commitment to advancing the field of deep learning.

My goal is to contribute meaningfully to deep learning by improving diagnostic accuracy and expanding the capabilities of AI solutions. I am motivated by a genuine curiosity to solve complex problems and apply innovative ideas that can benefit society. With a solid foundation and a sincere passion for deep learning, I look forward to continuing my journey of exploration and contributing positively to the field.
