I'm a research enthusiast with a solid foundation in Computer Vision. Currently, I'm a Research Assistant in the [Vision, Language, and Learning Group (VL2G)](https://vl2g.github.io) at the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, supervised by [Dr. Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/). I am working on enhancing historical Indian language manuscripts and applying AI in Health Care.

My academic journey includes a Master's in Computer Science from the [Central University of Rajasthan](https://www.curaj.ac.in), where I honed my research skills and co-authored scholarly articles on deep learning methodologies under the guidance of [Dr. Gaurav Meena](https://www.curaj.ac.in/faculty/gaurav-meena) and [Dr. Krishna Kumar Mohbey](https://www.curaj.ac.in/faculty/krishna-kumar-mohbey)
