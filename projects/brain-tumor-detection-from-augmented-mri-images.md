    In this project, brain tumors were detected from MRI images using a fine-tuned Deep CNN model trained on the Br35H benchmark dataset. The model was trained using k-fold cross-validation to demonstrate model generalization and Grad-CAM to visualize and interpret model predictions. The results were published in the Journal of Autonomous Intelligence by Frontier Scientific Publishing.
