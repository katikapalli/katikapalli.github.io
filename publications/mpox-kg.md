abstract: >
  People have recently begun communicating their thoughts and viewpoints through user-generated multimedia material on social networking websites, including images, text, videos, or audio; with the help of knowledge graphs, it is possible to extract organized knowledge from texts and images to aid in semantic analysis, a pattern that has become increasingly common in recent years; Twitter, being one of the most extensively utilized social media sites, offers insights into public sentiment regarding Monkeypox due to its short and frequently updated tweet format; the fundamental objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of how people react to the presence of this disease, focusing on analyzing public sentiment using a hybrid deep learning technique combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM); the study evaluates tweets with positive, negative, and neutral polarities; knowledge graphs are integrated into healthcare applications to enhance data representation and inference, proving beneficial for healthcare analytics; in this study, a knowledge graph of related events derived from Twitter data is presented to provide a real-time and eventful source of new information; the proposed model achieved 94% accuracy on the Monkeypox tweet dataset, with additional performance metrics like recall and F1-score used to validate the approach against traditional machine learning methods; further, semantic recognition capabilities were enhanced through knowledge graphs, and the findings of this research contribute to increased public awareness of Monkeypox infections.

  A hybrid deep learning framework combining CNN and LSTM is proposed for sentiment polarity detection on Monkeypox tweets, integrated with knowledge graph construction to enhance semantic understanding and event-based healthcare insights.
